                    <h4>4. RTN QR Pay Accounts</h4>
                    <p>Your RTN QR Pay account gives you access to the services and functionality that we may establish
                        and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion. We may maintain different types of
                        accounts for different types of users. By connecting to RTN QR Pay with a third-party service,
                        you give us permission to access and use your information from that service as permitted by that
                        service, and to store your log-in credentials for that service.</p>

                        permission. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you
                        must keep your account password secure. We encourage you to use “strong” passwords (passwords
                        that use a combination of upper-and-lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your account.
                        You may not allow any other party to access or use the Platform with your unique username,
                        password, or other security code. RTN QR Pay will not be liable for any losses caused by any
                        unauthorized use of your account.</p>

                        Platform. By giving RTN QR Pay your email address, you agree that we may use it to communicate
                        with you regarding the Platform via email rather than postal mail. This includes any notices
                        required by law. Your email address might also be used by us to send you notifications about
                        promotions and updates to Platform features. You might stop receiving emails about updates,
                        upgrades, or offers if you choose to opt out.</p>
                    <h4>5. Payments</h4>
                    <p>Authorization. By accepting these Terms, you expressly authorize RTN QR Pay to hold, receive,
                        disburse and settle funds on your behalf. Such authorization shall permit RTN QR Pay to receive
                        Customer Payment pursuant to a Transaction into a bank account controlled by RTN QR Pay to
                        further process each Transaction. RTN QR Pay shall process and transfer such payments received
                        by it to a For-Benefit-of (FBO) account created through our banking partners’ service offerings
                        or other bank account designated for this purpose at the time of registration and/or any such
                        account as instructed by you (“Merchant Account”). The authorization provided herein under shall
                        remain in full force and effect until specifically terminated.</p>
                    <p>By using the Platform to collect Customer Payment, you acknowledge and agree that RTN QR Pay is
                        acting as your agent for the collection and processing of payments made by Customer on your
                        behalf. You further acknowledge and agree that your receipt of any Customer Payment paid to you
                        satisfies the Customer’s obligations to you for the goods and/or services sold.</p>
                    <p>Transfer and Transaction Fees. RTN QR Pay will initiate transfer of the relevant Customer
                        Payments received by it to the respective Merchant Account within such days as described in our
                        “Payment Method” interface, from the date of receipt of the relevant Customer Payment, after
                        deduction of Transaction Fees and charges as agreed under these Terms. The “Transaction Fees”
                        means the applicable fees Merchants paid for its use of the Platform as further described on our
                        [price page].</p>
                    <p>Refund. By completing a Transaction and accepting Customer Payment, you agree to process returns
                        of, and provide refunds and adjustments for, your goods or services through your RTN QR Pay
                        Account in accordance with these Terms. You must disclose your return or cancellation policy to
                        Customers at the time of purchase. The amount of the refund/adjustment must include any
                        associated taxes required to be refunded and cannot exceed the amount shown as the total on the
                        original sales data. If your refund policy prohibits returns or is unsatisfactory to the
                        Customer, you may still receive a Chargeback relating to such sales.</p>
                    <p>By processing refunds through RTN QR Pay, you authorize RTN QR Pay to deduct the money from your
                        RTN QR Pay banking account or from future pay-outs.</p>
                    <p>Chargeback. There may be times when your Customer may not be the authorized payer of the Customer
                        Payment or your Customer may otherwise contest the transaction. In these instances, the amount
                        of a Transaction may be reversed or charged back to your Merchant Account (a “Chargeback”) if
                        the transaction (a) is disputed, (b) is reversed for any reason by the debit/credit card
                        issuers, our processor, or a Customer or its financial institution, (c) was not authorized or we
                        have any reason to believe that the transaction was not authorized, or (d) is allegedly
                        unlawful, suspicious, or in violation of these Terms. You agree to comply with the Chargeback
                        process and to the liability associated with such Chargebacks.</p>
                    <p>For any transaction that results in a Chargeback, you grant us the authorization to recover funds
                        from you concerning the Chargebacks pursuant to which we may recover the amount of any
                        Chargeback and any associated fees, fines, or penalties, as applicable or assessed by the
                        credit/debit card issuer or our processor. You grant us the authorization to recover funds from
                        your RTN QR Pay banking account or future pay-outs for the chargebacks.</p>
                    <p>If you have pending Chargebacks, we may delay pay-outs to your Merchant Account. Further, if we
                        reasonably believe that a chargeback is likely with respect to any Transaction, we may withhold
                        the amount of the potential Chargeback from Customer Payment otherwise due to you until such
                        time that (a) a Chargeback is assessed due to a Customer complaint, in which case we will retain
                        the funds, (b) the period of time under applicable law or regulation by which your Customer may
                        dispute that the transaction has expired, or (c) we determine that a Chargeback on the
                        Transaction will not occur. If we are unable to recover funds related to a Chargeback for which
                        you are liable, you agree to pay us the full amount of the Chargeback immediately upon demand.
                        You agree to pay all costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and other legal expenses,
                        incurred by us for the collection of all amounts unpaid by you.</p>
                    <p>RTN QR Pay Disclaimer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, RTN QR Pay is not a party to and shall not
                        be held liable for any disputes, chargebacks or reversals amongst you and a Customer.</p>

                        either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than Georgia. These Terms shall be governed
                        by the internal substantive laws of the State of Georgia, without respect to its conflict of
                        laws principles. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the

                    <h4>14. Arbitration</h4>
                    <p>PLEASE READ THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND YOUR RIGHTS. EXCEPT WHERE
                        PROHIBITED BY LAW, YOU AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM THAT YOU MAY HAVE IN THE FUTURE MUST BE RESOLVED
                        THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE
                        WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY. THE RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT, SUCH
                        AS DISCOVERY OR THE RIGHT TO APPEAL, MAY BE MORE LIMITED OR MAY NOT EXIST. YOU AGREE THAT YOU
                        MAY ONLY BRING A CLAIM IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF (LEAD OR OTHERWISE) OR
                        CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU FURTHER AGREE THAT THE
                        ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS OR CLAIMS OR OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A
                        REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING.</p>
                    <p>THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.
                        HOWEVER, AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A COURT
                        (INCLUDING INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF OR STATUTORY DAMAGES), AND MUST FOLLOW THESE TERMS
                        AS A COURT WOULD.</p>
                    <p>Except as provided in subsection 14.9 below and to enforce an arbitrator’s decision hereunder,
                        all disputes, controversies, or claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement or a breach
                        thereof, the Privacy Policy, our relationship, or your use or attempted use of the Platform or
                        any product or service, shall be submitted to and finally resolved by individual, confidential
                        arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in effect. The
                        following terms shall apply. You, RTN QR Pay, or any involved third party may pursue a claim.
                        RTN QR Pay agrees to final and binding confidential arbitration should it have any claims
                        against you. Likewise, you agree to final and binding confidential arbitration should you have
                        any claims against RTN QR Pay. By agreeing to arbitrate, you waive the right to go to court and
                        agree instead to submit any claims to final and binding confidential arbitration. This
                        arbitration provision sets forth the terms and conditions of our agreement to final and binding
                        confidential arbitration and is governed by and enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act
                        (the “FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, as amended.</p>
                    <p>14.1 Required Pre-Dispute Procedures.</p>
                    <p>We acknowledge and agree that before initiating any claim against the other, we agree to first
                        contact the other with a written description of the dispute, which shall include all relevant
                        documents and information, and the proposed resolution. You may send the written description of
                        any dispute you have with us by e-mail to legal@rtnqrpay.com. RTN QR Pay will contact you by
                        letter at the billing address you provided to us or at the email address you provided to us. You
                        agree to negotiate with RTN QR Pay or its designated representative in good faith about your
                        problem or dispute. If for some reason the dispute is not resolved within 60 days after receipt
                        of the written dispute, we agree to the dispute resolution provisions below. Notwithstanding the
                        foregoing or any other term of this arbitration agreement, we will have the right to seek
                        injunctive or other equitable relief in state or federal court located in Milledgeville County,
                        Georgia to enforce these Terms or prevent an infringement of a third party’s rights or our
                        intellectual property rights, as stated in subsection 14.9 below. You hereby expressly consent
                        to, and forever waive any challenge to, the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of said
                        courts in such actions.</p>
                    <p>14.2 Commencing Arbitration.</p>
                    <p>You and RTN QR Pay agree to commence any arbitration proceeding within 1 year after the claim
                        arises (the 1-year period includes the required pre-dispute procedures set forth above) and that
                        any arbitration proceeding commenced after 1 year shall be forever barred</p>
                    <p>14.3 Arbitration Location.</p>
                    <p>If the amount in controversy is $1,000 or less, then the arbitration may be conducted by
                        telephone or by written submissions. Otherwise, the arbitration shall be conducted in
                        Milledgeville County, Georgia unless RTN QR Pay otherwise agrees to arbitrate in another forum
                        requested by you.</p>
                    <p>14.4 Organization, Rules, and the Arbitrator.</p>
                    <p>We each agree that any and all claims other than those exempted under subsection 14.9 below shall
                        be submitted to final and binding confidential arbitration before a single arbitrator of the
                        American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). Either party may commence the arbitration process by
                        submitting a written demand for arbitration with the AAA, and providing a copy to the other
                        party, within the time period set forth in subsection 14.2 above. The arbitrator shall be
                        selected by agreement of the parties or, if the parties cannot agree, chosen in accordance with
                        Rules of the AAA. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the
                        AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures in effect at the time of submission
                        of the demand for arbitration. The AAA’s Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling
                        1-800-778-7879. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to resolve any
                        dispute relating to the interpretation, construction, validity, applicability, or enforceability
                        of these Terms, the Privacy Policy, and this arbitration provision. The arbitrator shall have
                        the exclusive and sole authority to determine whether any dispute is arbitrable. The arbitrator
                        shall have the exclusive and sole authority to determine whether this arbitration agreement can
                        be enforced against a non-signatory to this agreement and whether a non-signatory to this
                        agreement can enforce this provision against you or RTN QR Pay.</p>
                    <p>14.5 Fees.</p>
                    <p>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s Rules. We
                        will reimburse the fees charged by the arbitrator for claims totalling less than $10,000 unless
                        the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, we will not seek attorneys’ fees
                        and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. In all other
                        respects, the parties shall each pay their own additional fees, costs, and expenses, including,
                        but not limited to, those for any attorneys, experts, documents, and witnesses.</p>
                    <p>14.6 Governing Law and Award.</p>
                    <p>The arbitrator shall follow the substantive law of the State of Georgia without regard to its
                        conflicts of laws principles. Any award rendered shall include a confidential written opinion
                        and shall be final, subject to appeal under the FAA. Judgment on the award rendered by the
                        arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Enforcements of any award or
                        judgment shall be governed by the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement
                        of Foreign Arbitral Awards.</p>
                    <p>14.7 Enforceability.</p>
                    <p>This provision survives termination of your account or relationship with RTN QR Pay, bankruptcy,
                        assignment, or transfer. If the class action waiver is deemed unenforceable (i.e.,
                        unenforceability would allow arbitration to proceed as a class or representative action), then
                        this entire arbitration provision shall be rendered null and void and shall not apply. If a
                        portion of this arbitration provision (other than the class action waiver) is deemed
                        unenforceable, the remaining portions of this arbitration provision shall remain in full force
                        and effect.</p>
                    <p>14.8 Miscellaneous.</p>
                    <p>Failure or any delay in enforcing this arbitration provision in connection with any particular
                        claim will not constitute a waiver of any rights to require arbitration at a later time or in
                        connection with any other claims except all claims must be brought within the 1-year limitation
                        period set forth above. This provision is the entire arbitration agreement between you and RTN
                        QR Pay and shall not be modified except in writing by RTN QR Pay.</p>
                    <p>14.9 Exceptions.</p>
                    <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, and as an exception to final and binding confidential arbitration,
                        you and RTN QR Pay both retain the right to pursue, in small claims court, any claim that is
                        within that court’s jurisdiction and proceeds on an individual (non-class) basis, including
                        overdue account matters within the small claims court’s jurisdiction. RTN QR Pay will not demand
                        arbitration in connection with any individual claim that you properly file and pursue in a small
                        claims court, so long as the claim is and remains pending in that court. The following claims
                        shall not be subject to final and binding arbitration and must be adjudicated only in the state
                        or federal courts located in the State of Georgia: (i) any dispute, controversy, or claim
                        relating to the infringement or validity of our proprietary rights, including without
                        limitation, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, copyrights, trade secrets, or patents, or
                        the intellectual property rights of a third-party; or (ii) an action by RTN QR Pay for
                        temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive relief, whether prohibitive or mandatory, or
                        other provisional relief, against you for breach or threatened breach of this Agreement. You
                        expressly agree to refrain from bringing or joining any claims that are excluded from final and
                        binding arbitration pursuant to this subsection 13.9 in any representative or class-wide
                        capacity, including but not limited to bringing or joining any claims in any class action or any
                        class-wide arbitration. Small claims matters may be filed in any small claims court with
                        personal and subject matter jurisdiction over the parties. For all other matters excluded from
                        final and binding arbitration by this subsection 13.9, the parties’ consent to exclusive
                        jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts located in Milledgeville County, Georgia,
                        and forever waive any challenge to said courts’ jurisdiction and venue.</p>
                    <p>14.10 Amendments.</p>
                    <p>RTN QR Pay reserves the right to amend this arbitration provision at any time. Your continued use
                        of the Platform, purchase of any product or services on or through the Platform, or use or
                        attempted use of a RTN QR Pay product or service, is affirmation of your consent to such
                        changes. Should the changes to this arbitration provision be material, RTN QR Pay will provide
                        you notice and an opportunity to opt-out. Your continued use of the Platform, purchase or use of
                        any products or services on or through the Platform, or use or attempted use of a RTN QR Pay
                        product or service, is affirmation of your consent to such material changes.</p>
                    <p>YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WOULD HAVE HAD A RIGHT TO LITIGATE THROUGH A COURT, TO HAVE A JUDGE OR
                        JURY DECIDE YOUR CASE, AND TO BE PARTY TO A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. HOWEVER, YOU
                        UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO HAVE ANY CLAIMS DECIDED INDIVIDUALLY AND ONLY THROUGH BINDING, FINAL,
                        AND CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT-OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION WITHIN
                        THIRTY (30) DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU PURCHASE, USE, OR ATTEMPT TO USE A SERVICE OR PRODUCT
                        PURCHASED ON OR THROUGH THE WEBSITE (WHICHEVER COMES FIRST) BY WRITING TO US AT
                        support@rtnqrpay.com . FOR YOUR OPT-OUT TO BE EFFECTIVE, YOU MUST SUBMIT A SIGNED WRITTEN NOTICE
                        IDENTIFYING ANY PRODUCT OR SERVICE YOU PURCHASED, USED OR ATTEMPTED TO USE WITHIN THE 30 DAYS
                        AND THE DATE YOU FIRST PURCHASED, USED, OR ATTEMPTED TO USE THE PRODUCT OR SERVICE. IF MORE THAN
                        THIRTY (30) DAYS HAVE PASSED, YOU ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO OPT OUT OF THIS PROVISION AND YOU MUST
                        PURSUE YOUR CLAIM THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION AS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT.</p>
                    <p>Should either party file an action contrary to this provision, the other party may recover
                        attorney’s fees and costs up to $1000.00.</p>
                    <h4>15. Severability</h4>
                    <p>In the event that a provision of these Terms is found to be unlawful, conflicting with another
                        provision of the Terms, or otherwise unenforceable, the Terms will remain in force as though it
                        had been entered into without that unenforceable provision being included in it.</p>
                    <p>If two or more provisions of these Terms are deemed to conflict with each other&#x27;s operation,
                        RTN QR Pay shall have the sole right to elect which provision remains in force.</p>
                    <h4>16. Non-Waiver</h4>
                    <p>We reserve all rights permitted to us under these Terms as well as under the provisions of any
                        applicable law. Our non-enforcement of any particular provision or provisions of these Terms or
                        any applicable law should not be construed as our waiver of the right to enforce that same
                        provision under the same or different circumstances at any time in the future.</p>
                    <h4>17. Our Termination and Cancellation Rights</h4>
                    <p>We may terminate or suspend the Platform or your account or any other provision thereof at our
                        discretion without explanation and notice, though we will strive to provide a timely explanation
                        in most cases. If you wish to terminate these Terms or the RTN QR Pay account, you are solely
                        responsible for properly cancelling your account. All provisions of these Terms which by their
                        nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation,
                        ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.</p>
                    <p>We may permanently or temporarily terminate or suspend your access to the Platform without notice
                        and liability for any reason, including if in our sole determination you violate any provision
                        of these Terms, or for no reason. Upon termination for any reason or no reason, you continue to
                        be bound by these Terms. If your account is terminated for any reason, you must obtain written
                        authorization from RTN QR Pay prior to establishing another account. If you attempt to establish
                        another account without obtaining such authorization, RTN QR Pay may permanently ban you from
                        the Platform. You may not have more than one active account at any time without the written
                        consent of RTN QR Pay in each instance.</p>
                    <h4>18. Assignment</h4>
                    <p>You may not assign your rights and/or obligations under these Terms to any other party without
                        our prior written consent. We may assign our rights and/or obligations under these Terms to any
                        other party at our discretion.</p>
                    <h4>19. Modifications</h4>
                    <p>We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add or remove portions of these Terms
                        on a going-forward basis at any time by posting the amended Terms on our website. Please check
                        these Terms periodically for changes. We may provide additional notice, such as an email message
                        or a message within the Platform, of any material changes, but such changes will be effective as
                        provided herein whether or not such message is sent or received. Unless we state otherwise,
                        changes are effective seven (7) days following the date posted on our website. If you continue
                        to use the Platform after the effective date, you agree to the changes. For the avoidance of
                        doubt, disputes arising under these Terms will be resolved in accordance with these Terms as in
                        effect at the time the dispute arises.</p>
                    <p>We may also change or discontinue the Platform in whole or in part at any time, in our sole
                        discretion. Such changes may include, but not be limited to, stop providing the Platform or
                        features of the Platform, to you or to RTN QR Pay users generally, or create usage limits for
                        the Platform. Your continued use of the Platform indicates your agreement to the changes.</p>
                    <h4>20. Amendments</h4>
                    <p>We may amend these Terms from time to time. If we do so we may notify you by email to the email
                        address you have provided us with, however we are not obliged to, and such modification shall be
                        effective upon our publishing of the revised Terms on the Website. You agree to be bound by and
                        changes to these Terms when you use our Website and Platform after any such modification is
                        posted on the Website. It is therefore important that you review these Terms regularly to ensure
                        you are updated as to any changes.</p>
