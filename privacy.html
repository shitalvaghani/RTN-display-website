                    <h4>A. Information You Provided to Us</h4>
                    <p>Personal Information: When you register for an account to access or utilize our Services (an
                        “Account”) or request to receive information about RTN Pay QR Payments or our Services, we may
                        ask for and collect Personal Information that can be used to identify you, which may include an
                        identifier such as a name, email address, postal address, phone number, social security number,
                        tax identification number or other government-issued identification number, or by factors
                        specific to them, such as their physical, genetic, economic or social identity (“Personal
                        Information”).</p>
                    <p>Commercial information: To enable our Services, we may also ask and collect information about the
                        products and services you sell (e.g., inventory, pricing and other data) and information about
                        your payment transactions (e.g., when and where the transactions occur, a description of the
                        transactions, the payment or transfer amounts, billing and shipping information, and payment
                        methods used to complete the transactions).</p>
                    <p>Payment Information: If you use the Services to receive payments, we ask you to provide us

                    <p>[We use third party payment processors (the “3rd Party Payment Processor(s)”) to assist in
                        securely processing your personally identifiable payment information, including recurring
                        charges (if any). The credit card information or other financial information that you provide is
                        encrypted and transmitted directly to the 3rd Party Payment Processors. We do not store your
                        credit card information and do not control and are not responsible for the 3rd Party Payment
                        Processor or its collection or use of your information.]</p>

                    <h4>B. Information Collected Automatically</h4>
                    <p>We also get data from the devices you use when you interact with our systems, like your location
                        or information about the device you’re using. We need this data to do things like help protect
                        your account from hackers, combat fraud, check if payments are being made or received legally
                        and by you, and make our products and services better for you and others.</p>
                    <p>The information we collect include your IP address, which is a number assigned to your computer
                        or internet-enabled device whenever you access the internet. It allows computers and servers to
                        recognize and communicate with one another. IP addresses from which visitors appear to originate
                        may be recorded for IT security and system diagnostic purposes. This information may also be
                        used in aggregate form to maintain and improve Service and to generate and analyze statistics
                        about Service and your use of Service.</p>
                    <p>We may use the following technology to automatically collect information from you:</p>
                    <p>Cookies: Cookies are text files put on your computer to collect standard internet log information
                        and visitor behaviour information. This information is then used to track visitor use of the
                        website and to create statistical reports on website activity. A cookie may also convey
                        anonymous information about how you browse the Services to us. A cookie does not collect
                        Personal Information about you.</p>
                    <p>You can set your web browser or device to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is
                        being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to
                        accept cookies is disabled.</p>
                    <p>Beacons: A web beacon is a small image file on a web page that can be used to collect certain
                        information from your computer, such as an IP address, the time the content was viewed, a
                        browser type, and the existence of cookies previously set by the same server. We only use web
                        beacons in accordance with applicable laws. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for
                        a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to our Service, to
                        monitor how our Users navigate the Service, or to count how many particular articles or links

                    <p>We may provide an option to access or register for Service through the use of your user name and
                        passwords for certain services provided by third parties (each, an “Third Party Service”), such
                        as through the use of your Google account. By authorizing us to connect with a Third-Party
                        Service, you authorize RTN Pay QR Payments to access and store the information that the
                        Third-Party Service makes available to us, and to use and disclose it in accordance with this
                        Policy. It is your responsibility to check your privacy settings for such Third-Party Services
                        (please review the terms of use and privacy policy of such Third-Party Services) to control what

                    <h4>Analytic Providers and/or Advertising Partners</h4>
                    <p>We work with (or may in the future work with) network advertisers, ad agencies, analytics service

                        a legal or equitable claim, or for the purposes of a confidential alternative dispute resolution
                        process. We may also share such information if we believe it is necessary in order to
                        investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations
                        involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our terms and

                    <h4>Aggregate Data</h4>
                    <p>We may also use aggregated personal data and statistics for the purpose of monitoring website
                        usage in order to help us develop and improve our Service.</p>
                    <h4>With your Consent</h4>
                    <p>We will otherwise only disclose your personal data when you direct us or give us permission to do
                        so, when we are required by applicable law or regulations or judicial or official request to do
                        so, or as required to investigate actual or suspected fraudulent or criminal activities.</p>
                    <p>Where we rely on your consent to process the Personal Information, you have the right to withdraw
                        or decline your consent at any time. Please note that this does not affect the lawfulness of the

                    <p>If we ask you to provide Personal Information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a

                        provision of your Personal Information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible
                        consequences if you do not provide your Personal Information). Similarly, if we collect and use
                        your Personal Information in reliance on our (or a third party’s) legitimate interests which are
                        not already described in this Notice, we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those
                        legitimate interests are.</p>

                    <h3 style="color: black;">4. How Long We Retain Your Personal Information</h3>
                    <p>We will retain your Personal Information for as long as is needed to fulfil the purposes outlined
                        in this Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
                        accounting or other legal requirements). When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to
                        process your Personal Information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not
                        possible (for example, because your Personal Information has been stored in backup archives),
                        then we will securely store your Personal Information and isolate it from any further processing
                        until deletion is possible. For Personal Information that we process on behalf of our Registered
                        Users, we will retain such Personal Information in accordance with the terms of our agreement
                        with them, subject to applicable law.</p>
